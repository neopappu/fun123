Perfect place to restart 🚀. Since you already know the concepts but struggle with syntax fluency, today should be all about **hands-on practice**. Think of it like learning a new language: you know the grammar rules, but you need to *speak it out loud* until it feels natural.  

Here’s a **one-day focused plan** for you:

---

### 📝 Step 1: Warm-up (30 min)
- Open a Python environment (IDLE, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, or even an online REPL like [replit.com](https://replit.com)).
- Write **tiny snippets** for each concept you know:
  - Declare variables of different types and typecast them.
  - Create a list, tuple, dict, and set with 3–4 items.
  - Write a simple function that adds two numbers.
  - Use `if-else` to check even/odd.
  - Write a `for` loop to print numbers 1–10.
- Don’t worry about mistakes—**debugging is part of fluency building**.

---

### 🔁 Step 2: Syntax Drills (45 min)
- Pick one concept (say, lists) and write **5 variations**:
  - Append items
  - Remove items
  - Slice
  - Iterate with a loop
  - Use `len()` and `in`
- Repeat the same with dicts and sets.
- Goal: **muscle memory**. You’ll start typing without second-guessing.

---

### 🎯 Step 3: Mini Challenges (1 hr)
Try these small problems:
1. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum.
2. Print all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a loop.
3. Create a dictionary of 3 students and their marks, then print the student with the highest marks.
4. Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it’s prime or not.

### 🕹️ Step 4: Fun Practice (30 min)
- Try a beginner coding site like:
  - [HackerRank Python practice](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-python)
  - [LeetCode Easy problems](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/)
  - [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) (start with level 8 kyu challenges)
- Do **just 2–3 problems today**. Don’t overdo it.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Reflection (15 min)
- Write down what syntax tripped you up most today.
- Tomorrow, start with those weak spots again before moving forward.

---

👉 For today alone: **focus on writing code, not reading theory.** Even if you only solve 2–3 tiny problems, you’ll feel syntax becoming smoother.  

Would you like me to create a **5-question practice quiz** (multiple-choice) on these basics so you can test yourself right now before coding?
